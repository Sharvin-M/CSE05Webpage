			<h2>What is Scareware?</h2>
			<p>Scareware is a type of cybersecurity attack that involves tricking users into believing that their 
				computer has been infected with a virus or malware. Scareware usually appears in the form of pop-up 
				ads or messages that claim to be from a legitimate antivirus software company or security provider.
				 The messages often warn the user that their computer is infected and prompt them to download and 
				 install a software program that will remove the malware.</p>

			<h2>Risks of Scareware Attacks</h2>
			<p>Scareware attacks can pose significant risks to computer users because they can lead to the
				 installation of malware or the theft of personal information. Scareware messages may look 
				 like legitimate security alerts, but they are often fake and designed to scare users into 
				 taking action. If a user downloads and installs the software recommended by a scareware message, 
				 they may actually be installing malware that can steal their personal information, such as usernames, 
				 passwords, and financial data. Scareware messages can also lead to the installation of ransomware, 
				 which can lock users out of their own files until they pay a ransom to the attacker.</p>

			<h2>Preventing Scareware Attacks</h2>
			<p>To prevent scareware attacks, computer users should be cautious when encountering pop-up ads or 
				messages that claim their computer is infected with malware. Users should never download or 
				install software from unknown sources or from messages that appear suspicious. 
				Instead, users should rely on legitimate antivirus software to detect and remove malware from their computer. 
				Additionally, users should keep their software and operating systems up to date with the latest security 
				patches to reduce the risk of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers.</p>
