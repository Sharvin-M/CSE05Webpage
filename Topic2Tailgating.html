		<h2>What is Tailgating?</h2>
		<p>Tailgating, also known as piggybacking, is a physical security breach that occurs when an unauthorized 
			individual gains access to a restricted area by following someone who has been granted access. 
			This type of attack is particularly prevalent in workplaces, where employees may hold open a door or allow someone to follow them without verifying their identity.
			 Tailgating can also occur in public places, such as parking garages, where someone may follow another driver through a security gate.</p>

		<h2>Risks of Tailgating Attacks</h2>
		<p>Tailgating attacks pose a significant cybersecurity risk to organizations because they can give unauthorized individuals access to 
			sensitive information, data, and systems.
			 For example, an employee who holds open a secure door for a stranger may inadvertently allow them to access an area with sensitive information or equipment, 
			 such as servers or computers. Once inside, the attacker can steal data or install malware on 
			 the system, leading to a data breach or other cybersecurity incident.</p>

		<h2>Preventing Tailgating Attacks</h2>
		<p>To prevent tailgating attacks, organizations should implement strong physical security measures, 
			such as access control systems, security cameras, and security personnel.
			 Access control systems can help prevent unauthorized access by requiring employees to use a key card or enter a code to gain entry to restricted areas.
			  Security cameras can help monitor who is entering and exiting a location, and security personnel can verify the
			   identity of individuals before allowing them access to
			  restricted areas.</p>
		<p>In addition to physical security measures, organizations should also provide training and awareness to their employees on the importance of maintaining 
			security protocols, such as not holding open secure doors or allowing strangers to follow them into restricted areas. By implementing these measures
			 and educating employees on the risks of tailgating attacks, organizations can significantly reduce their risk of a cybersecurity breach.</p>
