			<h2>Why did we choose Social Engineering?</h2>
			<p>As computer systems continue to develop and become more integrated into society, computer security as a whole is growing in importance. 
				Social Engineering is the act of taking advantage of human error in a given computer system in order to gain access to sensitive information. 
				Although technology is being developed to counter malware, there is little being done to combat Social Engineering. 
				It remains that the human is the weakest link in any given system;Thus it is imperative that we educate ourselves on common social
                 engineering acts and develop practices to prevent them from happening.</p>
